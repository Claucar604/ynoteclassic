Macros
===
Macros contain a sequence of commands that are executed when called. Macros are used to avoid repetitive tasks to improve productivity.
Ynote macros are xml files with .ynotemacro extension. They can be saved anywhere in the **$ynotedata** directory, preferable in the User directory.

Recording a Macro
---
A macro can be recorded/stopped using the keys **Ctrl+M** or the **Macros->Start/Stop Recording** Menu.
You can redo the above to stop recording the macro. The macro recorded can be run using the **Macros->Playback Macro** menu or using **Ctrl+E**. This macro is currently not saved and is instead in the macro buffer. To save it, use **Macros->Save Recorded Macro** and save it anywhere in $ynotedata.

Executing Macros
---
You can execute a macro using Ctrl+E if it's in the macro buffer, else you can use the Macros->Macros->{Macro Name} or use any shortcut assigned to it.
